	There are 356 Unique profile id's in the user table and we assume all these are Unique users.
	These people varied from Unknown,HobbyProgrammer,Student,ResearcherAcademic,ResearcherIndustry and
	SoftwareEngineer.Unknown=78,HobbyProgrammer=20,Student=27,ResearcherAcademic=38,ResearcherIndustry=2
	SoftwareEngineer=191. To talk about their Education, Unknown:82, 10 of them has None,41 of them are Autodidact,
	Training=8,106 has bachelors degree, 5 of them has masters and 2 of them has PHD's.
	To understand the programming experience, 0-2 as beginners, 3-5 as mid and 6 and 7 as highly experience.
	{'high': 155, 'beg': 54, 'mid': 147}. 112 of them claimed that they do Code Reviews,168 of them they dint 
	do code review. The experienced developers and mid level developers seems to be interested to work 
	more in Solo, Small and Medium projects not that much with Large Projects. For Beginner level, information
	is not proper. Apparently 55 of them has not worked in any of projects. For these people, Education is 
	mostly unknown and their position is unknown. We include everyone with a unique IDE user id for all
	further study.
